# Test Netatmo Creadentials
A very simple way to test the login credentials and return values.

Its a simple HTML page that submits values to the netatmo API.
Once you have created your APP on dev.netatmo.com you can a) get an oAuth token and b) retreive station data.

Good for start or debuging.

Yes. Very basic. But it helps to solve like "error: invalid_client".
